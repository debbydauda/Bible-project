GAL,1,1,"From Paul, whose call to be an apostle did not come from human beings or by human means, but from Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from death.",GNBDC
GAL,1,2,All the brothers and sisters who are here join me in sending greetings to the churches of Galatia:,GNBDC
GAL,1,3,May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace.,GNBDC
GAL,1,4,"In order to set us free from this present evil age, Christ gave himself for our sins, in obedience to the will of our God and Father.",GNBDC
GAL,1,5,To God be the glory for ever and ever! Amen.,GNBDC
GAL,1,6,"I am surprised at you! In no time at all you are deserting the one who called you by the grace of Christ,",GNBDC
GAL,1,7,"Actually, there is no “other gospel”, but I say this because there are some people who are upsetting you and trying to change the gospel of Christ.",GNBDC
GAL,1,8,"But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel that is different from the one we preached to you, may he be condemned to hell!",GNBDC
GAL,1,9,"We have said it before, and now I say it again: if anyone preaches to you a gospel that is different from the one you accepted, may he be condemned to hell!",GNBDC
GAL,1,10,"Does this sound as if I am trying to win human approval? No indeed! What I want is God's approval! Am I trying to be popular with people? If I were still trying to do so, I would not be a servant of Christ.",GNBDC
GAL,1,11,"Let me tell you, my brothers and sisters, that the gospel I preach is not of human origin.",GNBDC
GAL,1,12,"I did not receive it from any human being, nor did anyone teach it to me. It was Jesus Christ himself who revealed it to me.",GNBDC
GAL,1,14,"I was ahead of most fellow-Jews of my age in my practice of the Jewish religion, and was much more devoted to the traditions of our ancestors.",GNBDC
GAL,1,16,"to reveal his Son to me, so that I might preach the Good News about him to the Gentiles, I did not go to anyone for advice,",GNBDC
GAL,1,17,"nor did I go to Jerusalem to see those who were apostles before me. Instead, I went at once to Arabia, and then I returned to Damascus.",GNBDC
GAL,1,18,"It was three years later that I went to Jerusalem to obtain information from Peter, and I stayed with him for two weeks.",GNBDC
GAL,1,19,"I did not see any other apostle except James,",GNBDC
GAL,1,20,What I write is true. God knows that I am not lying!,GNBDC
GAL,1,21,Afterwards I went to places in Syria and Cilicia.,GNBDC
GAL,1,22,At that time the members of the churches in Judea did not know me personally.,GNBDC
GAL,1,23,They knew only what others were saying: “The man who used to persecute us is now preaching the faith that he once tried to destroy!”,GNBDC
GAL,1,24,And so they praised God because of me.,GNBDC
GAL,2,2,I went because God revealed to me that I should go. In a private meeting with the leaders I explained the gospel message that I preach to the Gentiles. I did not want my work in the past or in the present to be a failure.,GNBDC
GAL,2,3,"My companion Titus, even though he is Greek, was not forced to be circumcised,",GNBDC
GAL,2,4,"although some wanted it done. Pretending to be fellow-believers, these men slipped into our group as spies, in order to find out about the freedom we have through our union with Christ Jesus. They wanted to make slaves of us,",GNBDC
GAL,2,5,"but in order to keep the truth of the gospel safe for you, we did not give in to them for a minute.",GNBDC
GAL,2,7,"On the contrary, they saw that God had given me the task of preaching the gospel to the Gentiles, just as he had given Peter the task of preaching the gospel to the Jews.",GNBDC
GAL,2,8,"For by God's power I was made an apostle to the Gentiles, just as Peter was made an apostle to the Jews.",GNBDC
GAL,2,9,"James, Peter, and John, who seemed to be the leaders, recognized that God had given me this special task; so they shook hands with Barnabas and me, as a sign that we were all partners. We agreed that Barnabas and I would work among the Gentiles and they among the Jews.",GNBDC
GAL,2,10,"All they asked was that we should remember the needy in their group, which is the very thing I have",GNBDC
GAL,2,11,"But when Peter came to Antioch, I opposed him in public, because he was clearly wrong.",GNBDC
GAL,2,12,"Before some men who had been sent by James arrived there, Peter had been eating with the Gentile brothers and sisters. But after these men arrived, he drew back and would not eat with the Gentiles, because he was afraid of those who were in favour of circumcising them.",GNBDC
GAL,2,13,The other Jewish brothers and sisters also started acting like cowards along with Peter; and even Barnabas was swept along by their cowardly action.,GNBDC
GAL,2,14,"When I saw that they were not walking a straight path in line with the truth of the gospel, I said to Peter in front of them all, “You are a Jew, yet you have been living like a Gentile, not like a Jew. How, then, can you try to force Gentiles to live like Jews?”",GNBDC
GAL,2,15,"Indeed, we are Jews by birth and not “Gentile sinners”, as they are called.",GNBDC
GAL,2,16,"Yet we know that a person is put right with God only through faith in Jesus Christ, never by doing what the Law requires. We, too, have believed in Christ Jesus in order to be put right with God through our faith in Christ, and not by doing what the Law requires. For no one is put right with God by doing what the Law requires.",GNBDC
GAL,2,17,"If, then, as we try to be put right with God by our union with Christ, we are found to be sinners as much as the Gentiles are — does this mean that Christ is serving the cause of sin? By no means!",GNBDC
GAL,2,18,"If I start to rebuild the system of Law that I tore down, then I show myself to be someone who breaks the Law.",GNBDC
GAL,2,19,"So far as the Law is concerned, however, I am dead — killed by the Law itself — in order that I might live for God. I have been put to death with Christ on his cross,",GNBDC
GAL,2,20,"so that it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me. This life that I live now, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave his life for me.",GNBDC
GAL,2,21,"I refuse to reject the grace of God. But if a person is put right with God through the Law, it means that Christ died for nothing!",GNBDC
GAL,3,1,You foolish Galatians! Who put a spell on you? Before your very eyes you had a clear description of the death of Jesus Christ on the cross!,GNBDC
GAL,3,2,Tell me this one thing: did you receive God's Spirit by doing what the Law requires or by hearing the gospel and believing it?,GNBDC
GAL,3,3,How can you be so foolish! You began by God's Spirit; do you now want to finish by your own power?,GNBDC
GAL,3,4,Did all your experience mean nothing at all? Surely it meant something!,GNBDC
GAL,3,5,Does God give you the Spirit and work miracles among you because you do what the Law requires or because you hear the gospel and believe it?,GNBDC
GAL,3,7,"You should realize then, that the real descendants of Abraham are the people who have faith.",GNBDC
GAL,3,8,The scripture predicted that God would put the Gentiles right with himself through faith. And so the scripture announced the Good News to Abraham: “Through you God will bless the whole human race.”,GNBDC
GAL,3,9,Abraham believed and was blessed; so all who believe are blessed as he was.,GNBDC
GAL,3,11,"Now, it is clear that no one is put right with God by means of the Law, because the scripture says, “Only the person who is put right with God through faith shall live.”",GNBDC
GAL,3,12,"But the Law has nothing to do with faith. Instead, as the scripture says, “Whoever",GNBDC
GAL,3,14,"Christ did this in order that the blessing which God promised to Abraham might be given to the Gentiles by means of Christ Jesus, so that through faith we might receive the Spirit promised by God.",GNBDC
GAL,3,15,"My brothers and sisters, I am going to use an everyday example: when two people agree on a matter and sign an agreement, no one can break it or add anything to it.",GNBDC
GAL,3,16,"Now, God made his promises to Abraham and to his descendant. The scripture does not use the plural “descendants”, meaning many people, but the singular “descendant”, meaning one person only, namely, Christ.",GNBDC
GAL,3,17,"What I mean is that God made a covenant with Abraham and promised to keep it. The Law, which was given 430 years later, cannot break that covenant and cancel God's promise.",GNBDC
GAL,3,18,"For if God's gift depends on the Law, then it no longer depends on his promise. However, it was because of his promise that God gave that gift to Abraham.",GNBDC
GAL,3,19,"What, then, was the purpose of the Law? It was added in order to show what wrongdoing is, and it was meant to last until the coming of Abraham's descendant, to whom the promise was made. The Law was handed down by angels, with a man acting as a go-between.",GNBDC
GAL,3,20,But a go-between is not needed when only one person is involved; and God is one.,GNBDC
GAL,3,21,"Does this mean that the Law is against God's promises? No, not at all! For if human beings had received a law that could bring life, then everyone could be put right with God by obeying it.",GNBDC
GAL,3,22,But the scripture says that the whole world is under the power of sin; and so the gift which is promised on the basis of faith in Jesus Christ is given to those who believe.,GNBDC
GAL,3,23,"But before the time for faith came, the Law kept us all locked up as prisoners until this coming faith should be revealed.",GNBDC
GAL,3,24,"And so the Law was in charge of us until Christ came, in order that we might then be put right with God through faith.",GNBDC
GAL,3,25,"Now that the time for faith is here, the Law is no longer in charge of us.",GNBDC
GAL,3,26,It is through faith that all of you are God's children in union with Christ Jesus.,GNBDC
GAL,3,27,"You were baptized into union with Christ, and now you are clothed, so to speak, with the life of Christ himself.",GNBDC
GAL,3,28,"So there is no difference between Jews and Gentiles, between slaves and free people, between men and women; you are all one in union with Christ Jesus.",GNBDC
GAL,3,29,"If you belong to Christ, then you are the descendants of Abraham and will receive what God has promised.",GNBDC
GAL,4,1,"But now to continue — the son who will receive his father's property is treated just like a slave while he is young, even though he really owns everything.",GNBDC
GAL,4,2,"While he is young, there are men who take care of him and manage his affairs until the time set by his father.",GNBDC
GAL,4,3,"In the same way, we too were slaves of the ruling spirits of the universe before we reached spiritual maturity.",GNBDC
GAL,4,4,"But when the right time finally came, God sent his own Son. He came as the son of a human mother and lived under the Jewish Law,",GNBDC
GAL,4,5,"to redeem those who were under the Law, so that we might become God's sons and daughters.",GNBDC
GAL,4,6,To show that you are,GNBDC
GAL,4,7,"So then, you are no longer a slave but a son or daughter. And since that is what you are, God will give you all that he has for his heirs.",GNBDC
GAL,4,8,"In the past you did not know God, and so you were slaves of beings who are not gods.",GNBDC
GAL,4,9,"But now that you know God — or, I should say, now that God knows you — how is it that you want to turn back to those weak and pitiful ruling spirits? Why do you want to become their slaves all over again?",GNBDC
GAL,4,10,"You pay special attention to certain days, months, seasons, and years.",GNBDC
GAL,4,11,I am worried about you! Can it be that all my work for you has been for nothing?,GNBDC
GAL,4,12,"I beg you, my brothers and sisters, be like me. After all, I am like you. You have not done me any wrong.",GNBDC
GAL,4,13,You remember why I preached the gospel to you the first time; it was because I was ill.,GNBDC
GAL,4,14,"But even though my physical condition was a great trial to you, you did not despise or reject me. Instead, you received me as you would an angel from heaven; you received me as you would Christ Jesus.",GNBDC
GAL,4,15,"You were so happy! What has happened? I myself can say that you would have taken out your own eyes, if you could, and given them to me.",GNBDC
GAL,4,16,Have I now become your enemy by telling you the truth?,GNBDC
GAL,4,17,"Those other people show a deep interest in you, but their intentions are not good. All they want is to separate you from me, so that you will have the same interest in them as they have in you.",GNBDC
GAL,4,18,"Now, it is good to have such a deep interest if the purpose is good — this is true always, and not merely when I am with you.",GNBDC
GAL,4,19,"My dear children! Once again, just like a mother in childbirth, I feel the same kind of pain for you until Christ's nature is formed in you.",GNBDC
GAL,4,20,"How I wish I were with you now, so that I could take a different attitude towards you. I am so worried about you!",GNBDC
GAL,4,21,Let me ask those of you who want to be subject to the Law: do you not hear what the Law says?,GNBDC
GAL,4,22,"It says that Abraham had two sons, one by a slave woman, the other by a free woman.",GNBDC
GAL,4,23,"His son by the slave woman was born in the usual way, but his son by the free woman was born as a result of God's promise.",GNBDC
GAL,4,24,"These things can be understood as a figure: the two women represent two covenants. The one whose children are born in slavery is Hagar, and she represents the covenant made at Mount Sinai.",GNBDC
GAL,4,25,"Hagar, who stands for Mount Sinai in Arabia, is",GNBDC
GAL,4,26,"But the heavenly Jerusalem is free, and she is our mother.",GNBDC
GAL,4,27,For the scripture says:,GNBDC
GAL,4,33,"“Be happy, you childless woman!",GNBDC
GAL,4,34,"Shout and cry with joy, you who never felt the pains of childbirth!",GNBDC
GAL,4,35,For the woman who was deserted will have more children,GNBDC
GAL,4,36,than the woman whose husband never left her.”,GNBDC
GAL,4,28,"Now, you, my brothers and sisters, are God's children as a result of his promise, just as Isaac was.",GNBDC
GAL,4,29,At that time the son who was born in the usual way persecuted the one who was born because of God's Spirit; and it is the same now.,GNBDC
GAL,4,30,"But what does the scripture say? It says, “Send the slave woman and her son away; for the son of the slave woman will not have a part of the father's property along with the son of the free woman.”",GNBDC
GAL,4,31,"So then, my brothers and sisters, we are not the children of a slave woman but of a free woman.",GNBDC
GAL,5,1,"Freedom is what we have — Christ has set us free! Stand, then, as free people, and do not allow yourselves to become slaves again.",GNBDC
GAL,5,2,"Listen! I, Paul, tell you that if you allow yourselves to be circumcised, it means that Christ is of no use to you at all.",GNBDC
GAL,5,3,Once more I warn any man who allows himself to be circumcised that he is obliged to obey the whole Law.,GNBDC
GAL,5,4,Those of you who try to be put right with God by obeying the Law have cut yourselves off from Christ. You are outside God's grace.,GNBDC
GAL,5,5,"As for us, our hope is that God will put us right with him; and this is what we wait for by the power of God's Spirit working through our faith.",GNBDC
GAL,5,6,"For when we are in union with Christ Jesus, neither circumcision nor the lack of it makes any difference at all; what matters is faith that works through love.",GNBDC
GAL,5,7,You were doing so well! Who made you stop obeying the truth? How did he persuade you?,GNBDC
GAL,5,8,"It was not done by God, who calls you.",GNBDC
GAL,5,9,"“It takes only a little yeast to make the whole batch of dough rise,” as they say.",GNBDC
GAL,5,10,"But I still feel confident about you. Our life in union with the Lord makes me confident that you will not take a different view and that the man who is upsetting you, whoever he is, will be punished by God.",GNBDC
GAL,5,11,"But as for me, my brothers and sisters, if I continue to preach that circumcision is necessary, why am I still being persecuted? If that were true, then my preaching about the cross of Christ would cause no trouble.",GNBDC
GAL,5,12,I wish that the people who are upsetting you would go all the way; let them go on and castrate themselves!,GNBDC
GAL,5,13,"As for you, my brothers and sisters, you were called to be free. But do not let this freedom become an excuse for letting your physical desires control you. Instead, let love make you serve one another.",GNBDC
GAL,5,14,For the whole Law is summed up in one commandment: “Love your neighbour as you love yourself.”,GNBDC
GAL,5,15,"But if you act like wild animals, hurting and harming each other, then watch out, or you will completely destroy one another.",GNBDC
GAL,5,16,"What I say is this: let the Spirit direct your lives, and you will not satisfy the desires of the human nature.",GNBDC
GAL,5,17,"For what our human nature wants is opposed to what the Spirit wants, and what the Spirit wants is opposed to what our human nature wants. These two are enemies, and this means that you cannot do what you want to do.",GNBDC
GAL,5,18,"If the Spirit leads you, then you are not subject to the Law.",GNBDC
GAL,5,19,"What human nature does is quite plain. It shows itself in immoral, filthy, and indecent actions;",GNBDC
GAL,5,20,"in worship of idols and witchcraft. People become enemies and they fight; they become jealous, angry, and ambitious. They separate into parties and groups;",GNBDC
GAL,5,21,"they are envious, get drunk, have orgies, and do other things like these. I warn you now as I have before: those who do these things will not possess the Kingdom of God.",GNBDC
GAL,5,22,"But the Spirit produces love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,",GNBDC
GAL,5,23,"humility, and self-control. There is no law against such things as these.",GNBDC
GAL,5,24,And those who belong to Christ Jesus have put to death their human nature with all its passions and desires.,GNBDC
GAL,5,25,The Spirit has given us life; he must also control our lives.,GNBDC
GAL,5,26,We must not be proud or irritate one another or be jealous of one another.,GNBDC
GAL,6,1,"My brothers and sisters, if someone is caught in any kind of wrongdoing, those of you who are spiritual should set him right; but you must do it in a gentle way. And keep an eye on yourselves, so that you will not be tempted, too.",GNBDC
GAL,6,2,"Help to carry one another's burdens, and in this way you will obey",GNBDC
GAL,6,3,"If someone thinks he or she is somebody when really they are nobody, they are only deceiving themselves.",GNBDC
GAL,6,4,"You should each judge your own conduct. If it is good, then you can be proud of what you yourself have done, without having to compare it with what someone else has done.",GNBDC
GAL,6,5,For we each have our own load to carry.,GNBDC
GAL,6,6,Those who are being taught the Christian message should share all the good things they have with their teachers.,GNBDC
GAL,6,7,Do not deceive yourselves; no one makes a fool of God. People will reap exactly what they sow.,GNBDC
GAL,6,8,"If they sow in the field of their natural desires, from it they will gather the harvest of death; if they sow in the field of the Spirit, from the Spirit they will gather the harvest of eternal life.",GNBDC
GAL,6,9,"So let us not become tired of doing good; for if we do not give up, the time will come when we will reap the harvest.",GNBDC
GAL,6,10,"So then, as often as we have the chance, we should do good to everyone, and especially to those who belong to our family in the faith.",GNBDC
GAL,6,11,See what big letters I make as I write to you now with my own hand!,GNBDC
GAL,6,12,"The people who are trying to force you to be circumcised are the ones who want to show off and boast about external matters. They do it, however, only so that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ.",GNBDC
GAL,6,13,Even those who practise circumcision do not obey the Law; they want you to be circumcised so that they can boast that you submitted to this physical ceremony.,GNBDC
GAL,6,14,"As for me, however, I will boast only about the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ; for by means of his cross the world is dead to me, and I am dead to the world.",GNBDC
GAL,6,15,It does not matter at all whether or not one is circumcised; what does matter is being a new creature.,GNBDC
GAL,6,16,"As for those who follow this rule in their lives, may peace and mercy be with them — with them and with all God's people!",GNBDC
GAL,6,17,"To conclude: let no one give me any more trouble, because the scars I have on my body show that I am the slave of Jesus.",GNBDC
GAL,6,18,"May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all, my brothers and sisters. Amen.",GNBDC
EPH,1,#,"To God's people in Ephesus,",GNBDC
EPH,1,2,May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace.,GNBDC
EPH,1,3,Let us give thanks to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! For in our union with Christ he has blessed us by giving us every spiritual blessing in the heavenly world.,GNBDC
EPH,1,4,"Even before the world was made, God had already chosen us to be his through our union with Christ, so that we would be holy and without fault before him.",GNBDC
EPH,1,8,Because of his love,GNBDC
EPH,1,5,God,GNBDC
EPH,1,6,"Let us praise God for his glorious grace, for the free gift he gave us in his dear Son!",GNBDC
EPH,1,7,For by the blood,GNBDC
EPH,1,8,which he gave to us in such large measure!,GNBDC
EPH,1,13,In all his wisdom and insight,GNBDC
EPH,1,9,"God did what he had purposed, and made known to us the secret plan he had already decided to complete by means of Christ.",GNBDC
EPH,1,10,"This plan, which God will complete when the time is right, is to bring all creation together, everything in heaven and on earth, with Christ as head.",GNBDC
EPH,1,11,"All things are done according to God's plan and decision; and God chose us to be his own people in union with Christ because of his own purpose, based on what he had decided from the very beginning.",GNBDC
EPH,1,12,"Let us, then, who were the first to hope in Christ, praise God's glory!",GNBDC
EPH,1,13,"And you also became God's people when you heard the true message, the Good News that brought you salvation. You believed in Christ, and God put his stamp of ownership on you by giving you the Holy Spirit he had promised.",GNBDC
EPH,1,14,"The Spirit is the guarantee that we shall receive what God has promised his people, and this assures us that God will give complete freedom to those who are his. Let us praise his glory!",GNBDC
EPH,1,15,"For this reason, ever since I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all God's people,",GNBDC
EPH,1,16,I have not stopped giving thanks to God for you. I remember you in my prayers,GNBDC
EPH,1,17,"and ask the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the glorious Father, to give you the Spirit, who will make you wise and reveal God to you, so that you will know him.",GNBDC
EPH,1,18,"I ask that your minds may be opened to see his light, so that you will know what is the hope to which he has called you, how rich are the wonderful blessings he promises his people,",GNBDC
EPH,1,19,and how very great is his power at work in us who believe. This power working in us is the same as the mighty strength,GNBDC
EPH,1,20,which he used when he raised Christ from death and seated him at his right side in the heavenly world.,GNBDC
EPH,1,21,"Christ rules there above all heavenly rulers, authorities, powers, and lords; he has a title superior to all titles of authority in this world and in the next.",GNBDC
EPH,1,22,God put all things under Christ's feet and gave him to the church as supreme Lord over all things.,GNBDC
EPH,1,23,"The church is Christ's body, the completion of him who himself completes all things everywhere.",GNBDC
EPH,2,2,"At that time you followed the world's evil way; you obeyed the ruler of the spiritual powers in space, the spirit who now controls the people who disobey God.",GNBDC
EPH,2,3,"Actually all of us were like them and lived according to our natural desires, doing whatever suited the wishes of our own bodies and minds. In our natural condition we, like everyone else, were destined to suffer God's anger.",GNBDC
EPH,2,4,"But God's mercy is so abundant, and his love for us is so great,",GNBDC
EPH,2,5,that while we were spiritually dead in our disobedience he brought us to life with Christ. It is by God's grace that you have been saved.,GNBDC
EPH,2,6,In our union with Christ Jesus he raised us up with him to rule with him in the heavenly world.,GNBDC
EPH,2,7,He did this to demonstrate for all time to come the extraordinary greatness of his grace in the love he showed us in Christ Jesus.,GNBDC
EPH,2,8-9,"For it is by God's grace that you have been saved through faith. It is not the result of your own efforts, but God's gift, so that no one can boast about it.",GNBDC
EPH,2,10,"God has made us what we are, and in our union with Christ Jesus he has created us for a life of good deeds, which he has already prepared for us to do.",GNBDC
EPH,2,11,"You Gentiles by birth — called “the uncircumcised” by the Jews, who call themselves “the circumcised” (which refers to what men do to their bodies) — remember what you were in the past.",GNBDC
EPH,2,12,"At that time you were apart from Christ. You were foreigners and did not belong to God's chosen people. You had no part in the covenants, which were based on God's promises to his people, and you lived in this world without hope and without God.",GNBDC
EPH,2,13,"But now, in union with Christ Jesus, you who used to be far away have been brought near by the blood",GNBDC
EPH,2,14,For Christ himself has brought us peace by making Jews and Gentiles one people. With his own body he broke down the wall that separated them and kept them enemies.,GNBDC
EPH,2,15,"He abolished the Jewish Law with its commandments and rules, in order to create out of the two races one new people in union with himself, in this way making peace.",GNBDC
EPH,2,16,By his death on the cross Christ destroyed their enmity; by means of the cross he united both races into one body and brought them back to God.,GNBDC
EPH,2,17,"So Christ came and preached the Good News of peace to all — to you Gentiles, who were far away from God, and to the Jews, who were near to him.",GNBDC
EPH,2,18,"It is through Christ that all of us, Jews and Gentiles, are able to come in the one Spirit into the presence of the Father.",GNBDC
EPH,2,19,"So then, you Gentiles are not foreigners or strangers any longer; you are now fellow-citizens with God's people and members of the family of God.",GNBDC
EPH,2,20,"You, too, are built upon the foundation laid by the apostles and prophets,",GNBDC
EPH,2,21,He is the one who holds the whole building together and makes it grow into a sacred temple dedicated to the Lord.,GNBDC
EPH,2,22,In union with him you too are being built together with all the others into a place where God lives through his Spirit.,GNBDC
EPH,3,1,"For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles, pray to God.",GNBDC
EPH,3,2,Surely you have heard that God in his grace has given me this work to do for your good.,GNBDC
EPH,3,3,"God revealed his secret plan and made it known to me. (I have written briefly about this,",GNBDC
EPH,3,4,"and if you will read what I have written, you can learn about my understanding of the secret of Christ.)",GNBDC
EPH,3,5,"In past times human beings were not told this secret, but God has revealed it now by the Spirit to his holy apostles and prophets.",GNBDC
EPH,3,6,The secret is that by means of the gospel the Gentiles have a part with the Jews in God's blessings; they are members of the same body and share in the promise that God made through Christ Jesus.,GNBDC
EPH,3,7,"I was made a servant of the gospel by God's special gift, which he gave me through the working of his power.",GNBDC
EPH,3,8,"I am less than the least of all God's people; yet God gave me this privilege of taking to the Gentiles the Good News about the infinite riches of Christ,",GNBDC
EPH,3,9,"and of making all people see how God's secret plan is to be put into effect. God, who is the Creator of all things, kept his secret hidden through all the past ages,",GNBDC
EPH,3,10,"in order that at the present time, by means of the church, the angelic rulers and powers in the heavenly world might learn of his wisdom in all its different forms.",GNBDC
EPH,3,11,"God did this according to his eternal purpose, which he achieved through Christ Jesus our Lord.",GNBDC
EPH,3,12,In union with Christ and through our faith in him we have the boldness to go into God's presence with all confidence.,GNBDC
EPH,3,13,"I beg you, then, not to be discouraged because I am suffering for you; it is all for your benefit.",GNBDC
EPH,3,14,"For this reason I fall on my knees before the Father,",GNBDC
EPH,3,15,from whom every family in heaven and on earth receives its true name.,GNBDC
EPH,3,16,"I ask God from the wealth of his glory to give you power through his Spirit to be strong in your inner selves,",GNBDC
EPH,3,17,"and I pray that Christ will make his home in your hearts through faith. I pray that you may have your roots and foundation in love,",GNBDC
EPH,3,18,"so that you, together with all God's people, may have the power to understand how broad and long, how high and deep, is Christ's love.",GNBDC
EPH,3,19,"Yes, may you come to know his love — although it can never be fully known — and so be completely filled with the very nature of God.",GNBDC
EPH,3,20,"To him who by means of his power working in us is able to do so much more than we can ever ask for, or even think of:",GNBDC
EPH,3,21,"to God be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus for all time, for ever and ever! Amen.",GNBDC
EPH,4,1,"I urge you, then — I who am a prisoner because I serve the Lord: live a life that measures up to the standard God set when he called you.",GNBDC
EPH,4,2,"Be always humble, gentle, and patient. Show your love by being tolerant with one another.",GNBDC
EPH,4,3,Do your best to preserve the unity which the Spirit gives by means of the peace that binds you together.,GNBDC
EPH,4,4,"There is one body and one Spirit, just as there is one hope to which God has called you.",GNBDC
EPH,4,5,"There is one Lord, one faith, one baptism;",GNBDC
EPH,4,6,"there is one God and Father of all, who is Lord of all, works through all, and is in all.",GNBDC
EPH,4,7,Each one of us has received a special gift in proportion to what Christ has given.,GNBDC
EPH,4,8,As the scripture says:,GNBDC
EPH,4,10,"“When he went up to the very heights,",GNBDC
EPH,4,11,he took many captives with him;,GNBDC
EPH,4,12,he gave gifts to people.”,GNBDC
EPH,4,9,"Now, what does “he went up” mean? It means that first he came down to the lowest depths of the earth.",GNBDC
EPH,4,10,"So the one who came down is the same one who went up, above and beyond the heavens, to fill the whole universe with his presence.",GNBDC
EPH,4,11,"It was he who “gave gifts”; he appointed some to be apostles, others to be prophets, others to be evangelists, others to be pastors and teachers.",GNBDC
EPH,4,12,"He did this to prepare all God's people for the work of Christian service, in order to build up the body of Christ.",GNBDC
EPH,4,13,"And so we shall all come together to that oneness in our faith and in our knowledge of the Son of God; we shall become mature people, reaching to the very height of Christ's full stature.",GNBDC
EPH,4,14,"Then we shall no longer be children, carried by the waves and blown about by every shifting wind of the teaching of deceitful people, who lead others into error by the tricks they invent.",GNBDC
EPH,4,15,"Instead, by speaking the truth in a spirit of love, we must grow up in every way to Christ, who is the head.",GNBDC
EPH,4,16,"Under his control all the different parts of the body fit together, and the whole body is held together by every joint with which it is provided. So when each separate part works as it should, the whole body grows and builds itself up through love.",GNBDC
EPH,4,17,"In the Lord's name, then, I warn you: do not continue to live like the heathen, whose thoughts are worthless",GNBDC
EPH,4,18,"and whose minds are in the dark. They have no part in the life that God gives, for they are completely ignorant and stubborn.",GNBDC
EPH,4,19,They have lost all feeling of shame; they give themselves over to vice and do all sorts of indecent things without restraint.,GNBDC
EPH,4,20,That was not what you learnt about Christ!,GNBDC
EPH,4,21,"You certainly heard about him, and as his followers you were taught the truth that is in Jesus.",GNBDC
EPH,4,22,"So get rid of your old self, which made you live as you used to — the old self that was being destroyed by its deceitful desires.",GNBDC
EPH,4,23,"Your hearts and minds must be made completely new,",GNBDC
EPH,4,24,"and you must put on the new self, which is created in God's likeness and reveals itself in the true life that is upright and holy.",GNBDC
EPH,4,26,"If you become angry, do not let your anger lead you into sin, and do not stay angry all day.",GNBDC
EPH,4,27,Don't give the Devil a chance.,GNBDC
EPH,4,28,"Those who used to rob must stop robbing and start working, in order to earn an honest living for themselves and to be able to help the poor.",GNBDC
EPH,4,29,"Do not use harmful words, but only helpful words, the kind that build up and provide what is needed, so that what you say will do good to those who hear you.",GNBDC
EPH,4,30,"And do not make God's Holy Spirit sad; for the Spirit is God's mark of ownership on you, a guarantee that the Day will come when God will set you free.",GNBDC
EPH,4,31,"Get rid of all bitterness, passion, and anger. No more shouting or insults, no more hateful feelings of any sort.",GNBDC
EPH,4,32,"Instead, be kind and tender-hearted to one another, and forgive one another, as God has forgiven you through Christ.",GNBDC
EPH,5,1,"Since you are God's dear children, you must try to be like him.",GNBDC
EPH,5,2,"Your life must be controlled by love, just as Christ loved us and gave his life for us as a sweet-smelling offering and sacrifice that pleases God.",GNBDC
EPH,5,3,"Since you are God's people, it is not right that any matters of sexual immorality or indecency or greed should even be mentioned among you.",GNBDC
EPH,5,4,"Nor is it fitting for you to use language which is obscene, profane, or vulgar. Rather you should give thanks to God.",GNBDC
EPH,5,5,"You may be sure that no one who is immoral, indecent, or greedy (for greed is a form of idolatry) will ever receive a share in the Kingdom of Christ and of God.",GNBDC
EPH,5,6,Do not let anyone deceive you with foolish words; it is because of these very things that God's anger will come upon those who do not obey him.,GNBDC
EPH,5,7,So have nothing at all to do with such people.,GNBDC
EPH,5,8,"You yourselves used to be in the darkness, but since you have become the Lord's people, you are in the light. So you must live like people who belong to the light,",GNBDC
EPH,5,9,for it is the light,GNBDC
EPH,5,10,Try to learn what pleases the Lord.,GNBDC
EPH,5,11,"Have nothing to do with the worthless things that people do, things that belong to the darkness. Instead, bring them out to the light.",GNBDC
EPH,5,12,(It is really too shameful even to talk about the things they do in secret.),GNBDC
EPH,5,13,"And when all things are brought out to the light, then their true nature is clearly revealed;",GNBDC
EPH,5,14,for anything that is clearly revealed becomes light.,GNBDC
EPH,5,17,"“Wake up, sleeper,",GNBDC
EPH,5,18,"and rise from death,",GNBDC
EPH,5,19,and Christ will shine on you.”,GNBDC
EPH,5,15,"So be careful how you live. Don't live like ignorant people, but like wise people.",GNBDC
EPH,5,16,"Make good use of every opportunity you have, because these are evil days.",GNBDC
EPH,5,17,"Don't be fools, then, but try to find out what the Lord wants you to do.",GNBDC
EPH,5,18,"Do not get drunk with wine, which will only ruin you; instead, be filled with the Spirit.",GNBDC
EPH,5,19,"Speak to one another with the words of psalms, hymns, and sacred songs; sing hymns and psalms to the Lord with praise in your hearts.",GNBDC
EPH,5,20,"In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, always give thanks for everything to God the Father.",GNBDC
EPH,5,21,Submit yourselves to one another because of your reverence for Christ.,GNBDC
EPH,5,23,"For a husband has authority over his wife just as Christ has authority over the church; and Christ is himself the Saviour of the church, his body.",GNBDC
EPH,5,24,And so wives must submit completely to their husbands just as the church submits itself to Christ.,GNBDC
EPH,5,26,"He did this to dedicate the church to God by his word, after making it clean by washing it in water,",GNBDC
EPH,5,27,"in order to present the church to himself in all its beauty — pure and faultless, without spot or wrinkle or any other imperfection.",GNBDC
EPH,5,28,Men ought to love their wives just as they love their own bodies. A man who loves his wife loves himself.,GNBDC
EPH,5,29,"(People never hate their own bodies. Instead, they feed them and take care of them, just as Christ does the church;",GNBDC
EPH,5,30,for we are members of his body.),GNBDC
EPH,5,31,"As the scripture says, “For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and unite with his wife, and the two will become one.”",GNBDC
EPH,5,32,"There is a deep secret truth revealed in this scripture, which I understand as applying to Christ and the church.",GNBDC
EPH,5,33,"But it also applies to you: every husband must love his wife as himself, and every wife must respect her husband.",GNBDC
EPH,6,2,“Respect your father and mother” is the first commandment that has a promise added:,GNBDC
EPH,6,3,"“so that all may go well with you, and you may live a long time in the land.”",GNBDC
EPH,6,6,"Do this not only when they are watching you, because you want to gain their approval; but with all your heart do what God wants, as slaves of Christ.",GNBDC
EPH,6,7,"Do your work as slaves cheerfully, as though you served the Lord, and not merely human beings.",GNBDC
EPH,6,8,"Remember that the Lord will reward everyone, whether slave or free, for the good work they do.",GNBDC
EPH,6,10,"Finally, build up your strength in union with the Lord and by means of his mighty power.",GNBDC
EPH,6,11,"Put on all the armour that God gives you, so that you will be able to stand up against the Devil's evil tricks.",GNBDC
EPH,6,12,"For we are not fighting against human beings but against the wicked spiritual forces in the heavenly world, the rulers, authorities, and cosmic powers of this dark age.",GNBDC
EPH,6,13,"So put on God's armour now! Then when the evil day comes, you will be able to resist the enemy's attacks; and after fighting to the end, you will still hold your ground.",GNBDC
EPH,6,15,and as your shoes the readiness to announce the Good News of peace.,GNBDC
EPH,6,16,At all times carry faith as a shield; for with it you will be able to put out all the burning arrows shot by the Evil One.,GNBDC
EPH,6,17,"And accept salvation as a helmet, and the word of God as the sword which the Spirit gives you.",GNBDC
EPH,6,18,"Do all this in prayer, asking for God's help. Pray on every occasion, as the Spirit leads. For this reason keep alert and never give up; pray always for all God's people.",GNBDC
EPH,6,19,"And pray also for me, that God will give me a message when I am ready to speak, so that I may speak boldly and make known the gospel's secret.",GNBDC
EPH,6,20,"For the sake of this gospel I am an ambassador, though now I am in prison. Pray that I may be bold in speaking about the gospel as I should.",GNBDC
EPH,6,22,"That is why I am sending him to you — to tell you how all of us are getting on, and to encourage you.",GNBDC
EPH,6,23,May God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give to all Christian brothers and sisters peace and love with faith.,GNBDC
EPH,6,24,May God's grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ with undying love.,GNBDC
COL,1,1,"From Paul, who by God's will is an apostle of Christ Jesus, and from our brother Timothy —",GNBDC
COL,1,2,"To God's people in Colossae, who are our faithful brothers and sisters in union with Christ:",GNBDC
COL,1,4,May God our Father give you grace and peace.,GNBDC
COL,1,3,"We always give thanks to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, when we pray for you.",GNBDC
COL,1,4,For we have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of your love for all God's people.,GNBDC
COL,1,5,"When the true message, the Good News, first came to you, you heard about the hope it offers. So your faith and love are based on what you hope for, which is kept safe for you in heaven.",GNBDC
COL,1,6,"The gospel keeps bringing blessings and is spreading throughout the world, just as it has among you ever since the day you first heard about the grace of God and came to know it as it really is.",GNBDC
COL,1,7,"You learnt of God's grace from Epaphras, our dear fellow-servant, who is Christ's faithful worker on our",GNBDC
COL,1,8,He has told us of the love that the Spirit has given you.,GNBDC
COL,1,9,"For this reason we have always prayed for you, ever since we heard about you. We ask God to fill you with the knowledge of his will, with all the wisdom and understanding that his Spirit gives.",GNBDC
COL,1,10,"Then you will be able to live as the Lord wants and will always do what pleases him. Your lives will produce all kinds of good deeds, and you will grow in your knowledge of God.",GNBDC
COL,1,11-12,"May you be made strong with all the strength which comes from his glorious power, so that you may be able to endure everything with patience. And with joy give thanks to",GNBDC
COL,1,13,"He rescued us from the power of darkness and brought us safe into the kingdom of his dear Son,",GNBDC
COL,1,14,"by whom we are set free, that is, our sins are forgiven.",GNBDC
COL,1,15,"Christ is the visible likeness of the invisible God. He is the firstborn Son, superior to all created things.",GNBDC
COL,1,16,"For through him God created everything in heaven and on earth, the seen and the unseen things, including spiritual powers, lords, rulers, and authorities. God created the whole universe through him and for him.",GNBDC
COL,1,17,"Christ existed before all things, and in union with him all things have their proper place.",GNBDC
COL,1,18,"He is the head of his body, the church; he is the source of the body's life. He is the firstborn Son, who was raised from death, in order that he alone might have the first place in all things.",GNBDC
COL,1,19,For it was by God's own decision that the Son has in himself the full nature of God.,GNBDC
COL,1,20,"Through the Son, then, God decided to bring the whole universe back to himself. God made peace through his Son's blood",GNBDC
COL,1,21,At one time you were far away from God and were his enemies because of the evil things you did and thought.,GNBDC
COL,1,22,"But now, by means of the physical death of his Son, God has made you his friends, in order to bring you, holy, pure, and faultless, into his presence.",GNBDC
COL,1,23,"You must, of course, continue faithful on a firm and sure foundation, and must not allow yourselves to be shaken from the hope you gained when you heard the gospel. It is of this gospel that I, Paul, became a servant — this gospel which has been preached to everybody in the world.",GNBDC
COL,1,24,"And now I am happy about my sufferings for you, for by means of my physical sufferings I am helping to complete what still remains of Christ's sufferings on behalf of his body, the church.",GNBDC
COL,1,25,"And I have been made a servant of the church by God, who gave me this task to perform for your good. It is the task of fully proclaiming his message,",GNBDC
COL,1,26,which is the secret he hid through all past ages from all the human race but has now revealed to his people.,GNBDC
COL,1,27,"God's plan is to make known his secret to his people, this rich and glorious secret which he has for all peoples. And the secret is that Christ is in you, which means that you will share in the glory of God.",GNBDC
COL,1,28,So we preach Christ to everyone. With all possible wisdom we warn and teach them in order to bring each one into God's presence as a mature individual in union with Christ.,GNBDC
COL,1,29,"To get this done I toil and struggle, using the mighty strength which Christ supplies and which is at work in me.",GNBDC
COL,2,1,Let me tell you how hard I have worked for you and for the people in Laodicea and for all others who do not know me personally.,GNBDC
COL,2,2,"I do this in order that they may be filled with courage and may be drawn together in love, and so have the full wealth of assurance which true understanding brings. In this way they will know God's secret, which is Christ himself.",GNBDC
COL,2,3,He is the key that opens all the hidden treasures of God's wisdom and knowledge.,GNBDC
COL,2,4,"I tell you, then, do not let anyone deceive you with false arguments, no matter how good they seem to be.",GNBDC
COL,2,5,"For even though I am absent in body, yet I am with you in spirit, and I am glad as I see the resolute firmness with which you stand together in your faith in Christ.",GNBDC
COL,2,6,"Since you have accepted Christ Jesus as Lord, live in union with him.",GNBDC
COL,2,7,"Keep your roots deep in him, build your lives on him, and become stronger in your faith, as you were taught. And be filled with thanksgiving.",GNBDC
COL,2,8,"See to it, then, that no one enslaves you by means of the worthless deceit of human wisdom, which comes from the teachings handed down by human beings and from the ruling spirits of the universe, and not from Christ.",GNBDC
COL,2,9,"For the full content of divine nature lives in Christ, in his humanity,",GNBDC
COL,2,10,and you have been given full life in union with him. He is supreme over every spiritual ruler and authority.,GNBDC
COL,2,11,"In union with Christ you were circumcised, not with the circumcision that is made by human beings, but with the circumcision made by Christ, which consists of being freed from the power of this sinful self.",GNBDC
COL,2,12,"For when you were baptized, you were buried with Christ, and in baptism you were also raised with Christ through your faith in the active power of God, who raised him from death.",GNBDC
COL,2,13,You were at one time spiritually dead because of your sins and because you were Gentiles without the Law. But God has now brought you to life with Christ. God forgave us all our sins;,GNBDC
COL,2,14,he cancelled the unfavourable record of our debts with its binding rules and did away with it completely by nailing it to the cross.,GNBDC
COL,2,15,And on that cross Christ freed himself from the power of the spiritual rulers and authorities;,GNBDC
COL,2,17,All such things are only a shadow of things in the future; the reality is Christ.,GNBDC
COL,2,18,"Do not allow yourselves to be condemned by anyone who claims to be superior because of special visions and who insists on false humility and the worship of angels. For no reason at all, such people are all puffed up by their human way of thinking",GNBDC
COL,2,19,"and have stopped holding on to Christ, who is the head of the body. Under Christ's control the whole body is nourished and held together by its joints and ligaments, and it grows as God wants it to grow.",GNBDC
COL,2,20,"You have died with Christ and are set free from the ruling spirits of the universe. Why, then, do you live as though you belonged to this world? Why do you obey such rules as",GNBDC
COL,2,21,"“Don't handle this,” “Don't taste that,” “Don't touch the other”?",GNBDC
COL,2,22,All these refer to things which become useless once they are used; they are only human rules and teachings.,GNBDC
COL,2,23,"Of course such rules appear to be based on wisdom in their forced worship of angels, and false humility, and severe treatment of the body; but they have no real value in controlling physical passions.",GNBDC
COL,3,2,"Keep your minds fixed on things there, not on things here on earth.",GNBDC
COL,3,3,"For you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.",GNBDC
COL,3,4,"Your real life is Christ and when he appears, then you too will appear with him and share his glory!",GNBDC
COL,3,5,"You must put to death, then, the earthly desires at work in you, such as sexual immorality, indecency, lust, evil passions, and greed (for greed is a form of idolatry).",GNBDC
COL,3,6,Because of such things God's anger will come upon those who do not obey him.,GNBDC
COL,3,7,"At one time you yourselves used to live according to such desires, when your life was dominated by them.",GNBDC
COL,3,8,"But now you must get rid of all these things: anger, passion, and hateful feelings. No insults or obscene talk must ever come from your lips.",GNBDC
COL,3,9,"Do not lie to one another, for you have taken off the old self with its habits",GNBDC
COL,3,10,"and have put on the new self. This is the new being which God, its Creator, is constantly renewing in his own image, in order to bring you to a full knowledge of himself.",GNBDC
COL,3,11,"As a result, there is no longer any distinction between Gentiles and Jews, circumcised and uncircumcised, barbarians, savages, slaves, and free, but Christ is all, Christ is in all.",GNBDC
COL,3,13,Be tolerant with one another and forgive one another whenever any of you has a complaint against someone else. You must forgive one another just as the Lord has forgiven you.,GNBDC
COL,3,14,"And to all these qualities add love, which binds all things together in perfect unity.",GNBDC
COL,3,15,The peace that Christ gives is to guide you in the decisions you make; for it is to this peace that God has called you together in the one body. And be thankful.,GNBDC
COL,3,16,"Christ's message in all its richness must live in your hearts. Teach and instruct each other with all wisdom. Sing psalms, hymns, and sacred songs; sing to God with thanksgiving in your hearts.",GNBDC
COL,3,17,"Everything you do or say, then, should be done in the name of the Lord Jesus, as you give thanks through him to God the Father.",GNBDC
COL,3,23,"Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as though you were working for the Lord and not for human beings.",GNBDC
COL,3,24,Remember that the Lord will give you as a reward what he has kept for his people. For Christ is the real Master you serve.,GNBDC
COL,3,25,"And wrongdoers will be repaid for the wrong things they do, because God judges everyone by the same standard.",GNBDC
COL,4,2,"Be persistent in prayer, and keep alert as you pray, giving thanks to God.",GNBDC
COL,4,3,"At the same time pray also for us, so that God will give us a good opportunity to preach his message about the secret of Christ. For that is why I am now in prison.",GNBDC
COL,4,4,"Pray, then, that I may speak, as I should, in such a way as to make it clear.",GNBDC
COL,4,6,"Your speech should always be pleasant and interesting, and you should know how to give the right answer to everyone.",GNBDC
COL,4,8,"That is why I am sending him to you, in order to cheer you up by telling you how all of us are getting on.",GNBDC
COL,4,9,"With him goes Onesimus, that dear and faithful brother, who belongs to your group. They will tell you everything that is happening here.",GNBDC
COL,4,11,"Joshua, also called Justus, sends greetings too. These three are the only Jewish believers who work with me for the Kingdom of God, and they have been a great help to me.",GNBDC
COL,4,13,I can personally testify to his hard work for you and for the people in Laodicea and Hierapolis.,GNBDC
COL,4,14,"Luke, our dear doctor, and Demas send you their greetings.",GNBDC
COL,4,15,Give our best wishes to the brothers and sisters in Laodicea and to Nympha and the church that meets in her house.,GNBDC
COL,4,16,"After you read this letter, make sure that it is read also in the church at Laodicea. At the same time, you are to read the letter that the brothers and sisters in Laodicea will send you.",GNBDC
COL,4,17,"And say to Archippus, “Be sure to finish the task you were given in the Lord's service.”",GNBDC
COL,4,18,With my own hand I write this:,GNBDC
COL,4,26,May God's grace be with you.,GNBDC
